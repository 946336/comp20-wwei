    <h2>
        <a id='intro'>Introduction</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are making a preliminary pass at the 2048 Highscore Center
        application <span class='applicationURI'>radiant-lake-20317</span> with
        the goal of finding flaws of any and all types, with an emphasis on
        security.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class='applicationURI'>radiant-lake-20317</span> is an application
    that stores scores from the popular game 2048. Scores are primarily
    associated with a username and a time, though additionally the final state
    of the grid is available upon request.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scores are submitted through the <span class='route'>POST
        /submit.json</span> route, with a score, a username, and a grid
        attached to the request as data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Detailed information may be requested in JSON format from the <span
        class='route'>GET /scores.json</span> route, provided that a
        username is provided as a query string (<span
            class='query_string'>?username=...</span>). All entries associated
        with that username are then returned as JSON. A failure returns an empty
        list and a failure status code.

        An overview of all scores tracked is accessible at the <span
            class='route'>GET /</span> route.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a id='methods'>Methodology</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        We first check for the obvious vulnerability: a username that is
        actually a payload that causes arbitrary javascript to execute when the
        leaderboard is shown. Since it looks like usernames are being displayed
        exactly as they are entered, we suspect that little to no sanitiation
        is being done.
    </p>

    <p>
        We then notice that the <span class='route'>GET /scores.json</span>
        route looks as if it is nothing more than a thin wrapper around a
        database call, so we attempt a database injection attack to see whether
        our query strings are sanitized before being passed along.
    </p>

    <p>
        We throw junk at <span class='route'>POST /submit.json</span> and <span
            class='route'>GET /scores.json</span> to see what kind of
        delightfully strange things happen.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a id='findings'>Abstract of Findings</a>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            People can put their own content on the webpage. In fact, people
            could have an internet war over whose stuff shows up on the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
            People can easily retrieve other people's scores. In fact, they can
            easily retrieve everyone else's scores
            <span class='emphasis'>without </span> knowing their usernames.
        </li>
        <li>
            The web application does not differentiate between junk input and
            valid input.
        </li>

                    injection via a query string in the form <span
                        class='route'>username[$ne]=username</span> causes all
                    scores for people whose usernames are <span
                        class='emphasis'>not</span> <span
                        class='query_string'>username</span> to be dumped. </p>

                    <p><span class='route'>GET /scores.json</span> does not
                    sanitize the query strings it accepts, allowing potentially
                    malicious query strings into the database driver.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class='issue'>Location</span>: Database injection
                    is possible along the <span class='route'>GET
                        /scores.json</span> route</p>

                    <p> <span class='issue'>Severity</span>: Medium </p>

                    <p> Since there is no sensitive data stored in the database
                    at the moment, and the vulnerability does not extend to
                    arbitrary code execution or arbitrary database operations,
                    attackers are limited in what they can obtain through this
                    vulnerability. </p>

                    <p> However, this vulnerability still represents a failure
                    to keep user data secure and a failure to keep usernames
                    private. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p> <span class='issue'>Suggested Resolution</span>:
                    Sanitize query strings to remove or escape character
                    sequences known to change the intent/behavior of the
                    database query. For example, the <span
                        class='query_string'>username</span> field should not
                    contain <span class='query_string'>[$ne]</span> in any
                    form.</p>

                    <p>
                    Since it seems like most of the mongoDB operators are of the
                    form <span class='code'>$XX</span>, it may be sufficient to
                    simply run the username through something in the spirit of
                    <span class='code'>username = username.replace(/\$/g,
                        ''))</span> to remove all instances of <span
                        class='code'>$</span>.</p>

    <h2>
        <a id='conclusion'>Conclusion</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
    The web application <span class='applicationURI'> radiant-lake-20317
    </span> has a number of security vulnerabilities, mostly stemming from a
    lack of distrust for user input. The issues found here can, for the most
    part, be mitigated by stricter checks on user input.
    </p>

    <p>
    The maintainer may also consider avoiding <span
        class='code'>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</span>, as
    that makes it very easy for data to be submitted from anywhere, not just
    the intended web application.
    </p>

    <p>
    The maintainer may also consider removing the explicit mongodb uri from the
    application source. Although this is not exposed to the client, it is one
    more small thing to change when transplanting applications, e.g. when
    testing locally.
    </p>

    <p>
    Below, we provide an interesting client-side error that results from the
    above issues but is not a new issue in and of itself.
